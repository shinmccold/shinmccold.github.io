Hi, I'm Shin McCold, a backend software engineer with a degree in Information Technology (2020). My primary expertise lies in Java and Python, while I currently work with Java professionally. In my spare time, I’m exploring Rust and constantly tinkering with new technologies in my remote work setup.

I love coding and recently became interested in AI, so I’m trying something out. Beyond coding, I’m passionate about content creation, animation, and traveling.

While I have some preferred tools, I always choose the best one for the job, even if it’s not on my usual list. My goal is to find the right solution for each project.

> Note: I write all my blog posts using Coffee, with no AI assistance.
